                <h3>Composite Molds</h3>
                <p>
                    A composite mold is a type of mold made from a combination of different materials, offering
                    lightweight, durable,
                    and flexible properties. It is typically made using materials such as carbon fiber, fiberglass,
                    aramid fiber, and resins.
                    These molds offer advantages over metal molds, including lighter weight, high strength, and heat
                    resistance.
                    Additionally, their flexible structure allows for the production of more complex shapes. Composite
                    molds are commonly
                    used in industries such as automotive, aerospace, sports equipment, and industrial manufacturing.
